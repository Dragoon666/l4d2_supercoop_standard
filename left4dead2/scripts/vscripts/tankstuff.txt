	// "SpawnBossThreats"
	// In CoOp games, controls whether or not a map can randomly spawn witches / tanks. 
	// By default, the first map in a campaign can't. 
	// If this value is set for a map, it overrides the default. (0 for false, 1 for true)
	
	// "versus_boss_spawning"
	// In versus games, there are a set of console variables that are used to govern how witches and 
	// tanks spawn. If you wish to override those defaults for a map in this campaign, you can do that here. 
	// If you don't specify a mapma or a specific value for a map, 
	// it will use the console variables defaults instead. 
	//
	// spawn_pos_min - (float: 0.01 ... 0.99)
	//	The minimum random position on a map to spawn a boss. 
	//	0.01 means right near the beginning, 0.99 means near the end
	// 
	// spawn_pos_max - (float: 0.01 ... 0.99)
	//	The maximum random position on a map to spawn a boss. 
	//	0.01 means right near the beginning, 0.99 means near the end
	//
	// tank_chance - (float: 0.0 ... 1.0)
	//	The random chance that a Tank will spawn, 0 being never and 1 being always.
	//
	// witch_chance - (float: 0.0 ... 1.0)
	//	The random chance that a witch will spawn, 0 being never and 1 being always.
	//
	// witch_and_tank - (int: 0 or 1)
	//	If both a witch and a tank randomly spawn, this controls whether 
	// 	the tank is supressed in favor of the witch. 
	// 	0 means only spawn the witch if they would both spawn, 1 means spawn them both. 
	//	
	
	// "VersusFinaleProgressScoreFactor" (float: 0.0 ... 1.0)
	// This controls how much of the player's progress through the finale (rather than movement through the map)
	// is counted towards their score. Generally, you want a higher number if there is little distance 
	// between the checkpoint and the finale, and a lower number if there is significant distance
	// from the checkpoint to the finale.
	// 0.0 is the default behavior, which means that the score is based on movement through the map. 
	// 1.0 means that the score is based completely on progress during the finale. 
	// 0.85 means that 85% comes from progress in the finale, and 15% from movement through the map. 
	
	// "VersusConvertPills" (float: 0.0 ... 1.0)
	// This controls how many pills are converted to kits at the beginning of the map. By default, 
	// the game references the director_vs_convert_pills convar for this value, but you can 
	// override it here. 
	
	// "ThirdTankDelay" (float: 0.0 .... 9999)
	// This controls the delay before the third tank is spawned in the finale. 
	// This is the tank that shows up while the survivors are rushing for the escape vehicle. 
	// By default, the delay is twice the "director_finale_stage_delay" convar. 
	
	// "FinaleVehicleEvent"
	// This allows designers to change what message is displayed when the escape vehicle is ready. 
	
	// "FinaleEscapeKillIncapped"  - (int: 0 or 1)
	// If set to 1, any characters that are incapped when the escape starts will be killed. 
	// This is primarily a cutscene aid, it doesn't change the way points are awarded, etc. 
	// By default, survivors are left alone
	
	// "SpawnFinalePZClose"  - (int: 0 or 1)
	// If set to 1, the Director will try to spawn PZs closer to the survivors during the 
	// finale, which can be useful for finales with a very large playable area and many potential
	// spawn locations. 
	// The behavior of this is controlled by the convars "z_finale_pz_spawnable_area_*".
	// By default, PZs are spawned randomly in the nav areas marked FINALE
	
	// "coop_boss_spawning"
	// In Co-Op & Single-Player games, there are a set of console variables that are used to govern how witches and 
	// tanks spawn. If you wish to override those defaults for a map in this campaign, you can do that here. 
	// If you don't specify a specific value for a map, 
	// it will use the console variables defaults instead. 
	//
	// Tanks and witches are spawned periodically at certain distances along the escape route, so the longer the map,
	// the more potential boss encounters you'll get. 
	//
	// "boss_threat_separation_min" - (float: 0.0 ... 100000.0)
	//  Minimum distance between boss spawns
	//
	// "boss_threat_separation_max" - (float: 0.0 ... 100000.0)
	//  Max distance between boss spawns
	//
	// "boss_threat_radius" - (float: 0.0 ... 10000.0)
	//  Random distance off the escape route that the boss can be spawned
	//
	// "spawn_witches" - (int: 0 or 1)
	//  Controls whether or not witches will spawn on the map
	//
	// "spawn_tanks" - (int: 0 or 1)
	//  Controls whether or not Tanks will spawn on the map
	//
